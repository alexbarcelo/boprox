The boprox client is used to connect to a boprox server. 

It synchronizes file with the server, and can manage all the client
actions (revision control, rollbacks, updates, adding shares...).

It's not a fully-featured client for end-users, is more a API that 
handles all filesystem and network communication and authentication
with the server.
