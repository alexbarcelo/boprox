Still no real installation mechanism.

Server is boproxd.py
See testingground/initserver.sh and testingground/testing.ini, they can be 
used to start a listening and fully-functional deaemon. Soon I will provide
some init.d samples, if you have a good init script I will be very grateful.

This project doesn't have a fully-featured client, but the test code in 
sampleClient.py is working as a one-shot-updater.

Basic instructions:
 1) (Only first use): Check path of hashesdir and sqlite files (open the 
    python code and change as needed). Create the folders. The default are:
      ~/.boprox/                  # file configuration
      ~/.boprox/hashesdir/        # internal hash directory
      ~/boprox-repo               # working repository
 2) Run sampleClient.py
 3) Work normally on the repository folder.
 4) Jump to step 2 whenever you want to synchronize from and to the server.

If you want to test an autoupdate client you can add a cron. Hourly cron
is a conservative good choice.
